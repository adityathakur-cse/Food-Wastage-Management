                  <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
                   <li>Plan your meals ahead of time. This will help you avoid overbuying and cooking too much food</li>
                    <li>Store food properly. Make sure to refrigerate or freeze food promptly after purchase.</li>
                    <li>Check your refrigerator and pantry regularly to use up food before it expires</li>
                    <li>Cook only what you need. Avoid overcooking leftovers.</li>
                    <li>Don't be afraid to eat imperfect produce. Many fruits and vegetables are still perfectly edible even if they are bruised or have blemishes.</li>
